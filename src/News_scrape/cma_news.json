    "content_text": "The first ever Global Early Warnings for All Multi-Stakeholder Forum is taking place to inject a sense of urgency and unity into the global ambition of protecting everyone everywhere with timely, life-saving early warnings.\nEYETALK\nCo-led by the UN Office for Disaster Risk reduction (UNDRR)  and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and supported by many partners, the forum offers a dynamic platform to review progress, showcase solutions, and accelerate the implementation the Early Warnings for All initiative and progress towards the Sendai Framework Target G.\n“An effective early warning system is the most basic tool for saving lives. Achieving Early Warnings for All by 2027 is ambitious but it is achievable,” said Selwin Hart Assistant Secretary-General of the Climate Action Team and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action and Just Transition.\nDespite progress, there are still major gaps in coverage, especially in developing countries. The Multi-Stakeholder Forum seeks to close the gaps by bringing together National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), disaster risk managers, policymakers, technical experts, civil society, youth, persons with disabilities, private sector actors, and development partners.\n“This momentum reinforces the critical role of multi-stakeholder collaboration in making Early Warnings for All a reality — no single actor can do it alone,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo in her opening address.\n“As the UN specialized agency for weather, climate and water, WMO  stands at the scientific core of early warning systems. Our work is technical but our purpose is human. The WMO community provides the science to see the storm before it strikes, the tools to track its path and the alerts that sound the alarm,” she said.\n“Yet no warning – however early – is effective unless it reaches the right people at the right time. And that is why we are here today. To cement our partnerships and trust which are essential to early action,” said Celeste Saulo.\nGlobal Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction\nThe forum takes place ahead of the Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction and coincides with Heat Action Day – an annual event to highlight the need for action against extreme heat, which is widely described as the silent killer.\nIt follows a major International Conference on Glacier Preservation in Tajikistan, which showed strong political will to strengthen early warning systems,  given that the melting of glaciers is leading to an increase in hazards like landslides and glacial lake outburst floods.\nThe tragedy of the glacier collapse which flattened the Swiss village of Blatten on 28 May highlighted the importance of early warnings and early action. Successfully coordinated disaster preparedness, management and response prevented loss of life, said Swiss Deputy Ambassador Julien Thoeni.\nRegional forums\nThe Global Multi-Stakeholder Forum is structured around six dynamic thematic sessions to ensure a comprehensive and action-oriented approach:\nPeople-centred  and user-tailored approaches for early warnings\nThe race for effective MHEWS in fragile and conflict settings\nEffective governance for MHEWS\nAdvancing MHEWS through science, technology and local knowledge\nAccelerating EW4ALL through international, regional and national cooperation and partnership\nSolutions for scaling and sustaining investments in MHEWS.\nIt reflects the discussions during the regional events over the past year. All five regional forums concluded that EW4All has made progress but needs to accelerate and close gaps.\nOne hundred and eight countries now report having Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems, said Kamal Kishore, head of UNDRR and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. “These are not just numbers. I am seeing the impact this is having on the ground,” he said.\n“For Sendai, this is our Now or Never moment,” he said. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 outlines clear targets and priorities.\nSuccess stories\nCeleste Saulo cited four examples of success, within the area of WMO’s mandate:\nWMO has stepped up real-time data sharing through the WMO Information System, with training and support to 90 countries in the last two years.\nAs tropical cyclones become more intense, WMO’s global network of regional specialized centres have updated cyclone forecasting guidance products so countries can benefit from more accurate forecasts and warnings.\nWMO has updated guidance on heat indicators and plan to increase support on heat advisories through its Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers in India, Singapore, Kenya and South Africa.\nWMO have developed technical regulations on early warning services to standardize service delivery.  This builds confidence and trust in NMHSs as the authoritative voice on weather, climate and water.\nWith support from Norwegian Capacity (NORCAP) and the Climate Risk and Early Warning System Initiative, WMO is supporting the digital transformation of NMHSs. Half the countries in Africa received technology and training.  This support increased the warnings published by countries by 2500% compared to the past and added 1000 new stations from Africa to the Global Basic Observing Network.\n“We can be proud of our success. But we must go further. And faster. And together,” said Celeste Saulo.\nShe said that five key points that should drive our action:\nThe science must connect to people.\nThe systems must be inclusive.\nThe partnerships must be expansive.\nThe benefits must be universal.\nWe must broaden the tent to embrace not just meteorologists and disaster managers alone, but also educators and farmers, mayors and mobile operators, engineers and indigenous leaders.\nThe CREWS Accelerator: Early Warnings for ALL project supports the organization of the Global Multi-Stakeholder Forum, which feeds into the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, which takes place every two years. This year’s theme is Every Day Counts, Act for Resilience Today.\nAhead of the Global Platform, UNDRR issued its flagship The Global Assessment Report 2025: Resilience Pays: Financing and Investing for our Future. It highlights how smarter investment can reset the destructive cycle of disasters, debt, uninsurability and humanitarian need that threatens a climate-changed world.\nSouce: WMO\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "WMO’s Executive Council has given a ringing endorsement to the WMO Youth Action Plan, setting the stage for a more impactful and inclusive approach to youth engagement within WMO.\nA quarter of the global population – 1.8 billion people – are between the ages of 15 and 24. Youth are future leaders and offer a wealth of expertise and innovation which is often not sufficiently reflected in current planning and decision-making – and WMO wants to redress this.\nTheir engagement and representation is especially important given the heightened vulnerability of younger generations to the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. Young people today are expected to face significantly more climate-related disruptions over their lifetimes, particularly in regions with limited resources for adaptation and resilience.\n“WMO is including the youth in decision-making processes. Youth is part of our DNA. Young people are working hard, and they matter to us because the future is theirs,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\nThe EC resolution recommends that the Extraordinary World Meteorological Congress in October 2025 adopt the Youth Action Plan. It invites Members to nominate a youth focal point to support the implementation of the plan.\n“Climate change is a generational challenge. It is very important that youth contribute to the work for adaptation and mitigation”, said Dwikorita Karnawati, Director of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics.\nThe Youth Action Plan represents a strategic shift toward structured, meaningful youth engagement within WMO’s institutional, technical, and governance processes. It is in line with the implementation of the UN Youth Strategy 2030 and aligns with the Pact for the Future, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2024, which calls for stronger youth participation in global decision-making.\n“The Plan promotes active and informed youth engagement to strengthen decision-making and ensure that young people help shape the future of weather, climate, and water services. It is a big step toward institutionalizing youth inclusion across WMO's strategic priorities and operations,” said Theophilus Wellington who presented the plan to Executive Council.\nYouth team speaking during WMO EC-79 - Agenda Item 7 - WMO Youth Action Plan 18 June 2025\nKey goals of the Youth Action Plan include:\nEstablishing a structured WMO youth body to contribute to decision-making.\nEnhancing youth capacity to contribute to future discussions on weather, water and climate.\nDeveloping youth-oriented communications and expanding collaboration with youth networks.\nThe plan was shaped through an extensive consultation process, which took place from August 2024 to January 2025. Contributors included focal points from WMO Regional Associations, Technical Commissions, and the Research Board, young staff from the WMO Secretariat, and international partners such as the UN Youth Office, YOUNGO, and youth representatives active at the UN Climate Change conference, COP29, in Azerbaijan in 2024.\nSource: WMO\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "Last week, a heart-stirring news came from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)'s Executive Council, which made the decision during its annual session in Geneva that Prof. XU Jianmin became the winner of the International Meteorological Organization (IMO) Prize.\nThe IMO Prize is the highest honor in the global meteorological community to recognize individuals with excellent achievements in the field of meteorology.\nAs Former Director-General of National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC) of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), XU Jianmin is one of the founders of China's FENGYUN (FY) meteorological satellites.\nProf. XU Jianmin Source: NSMC\nThe development of FY meteorological satellites is a microcosm of China's reform and opening-up and scientific and technological innovation. Nowadays, whether it is the dynamic demonstration in weather forecast programs or the real-time push in mobile applications, \"watching the weather from space\" has become commonplace. However, it is only in recent decades that humanity has truly achieved global monitoring via satellites.\nIn 1944, he was born in Shanghai. He studied meteorology in Nanjing University.\nDuring his studies, XU Jianmin met a teacher who had a great influence on him, ZHU Hezhou.\nZHU Hezhou told XU Jianmin that when observing data, one should be meticulous. Not only should one recognize the laws governing the occurrence and development of natural phenomena, but also think about and understand the reasons and mechanisms for their existence and compliance with these laws.\nUnder the influence of ZHU Hezhou's scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts and the rigorous scientific thinking, XU Jianmin also fostered the habit of \"exploring the vast nature and seeking patterns in the complexity\" since his college years.\nYears later, XU Jianmin still emphasized to his students day after day that meteorological science was not a discipline confined to the study. Observers had to distinguish all kinds of clouds, look at cloud maps 365 days a year, and let the data speak for itself.\nOne of the founders of China's FY meteorological satellites\nXU Jianmin designed the basic structure of the Chinese FY Meteorological Satellite Ground System, solving the key problems in FY meteorological satellite navigation. He also promoted the development of core technology for satellite-related products, and the application of FY meteorological satellite products to global observation, forecasting and services.\nHe put forward the general plan for the development of Chinese FY meteorological satellites in the early stage of their development (1986-1996), and was in charge of the design and construction of the ground system segment, and led the development of core technologies which contributed to the successful launch and application of China's first polar-orbiting (FY-1) and first geostationary (FY-2) meteorological satellites.\nGuided by the overall design concept of XU Jianmin, FY Polar-Orbiting Satellite program was successfully upgraded from the first generation (FY-1) to the second generation (FY-3), which improved its capability in quantitative application.\nXU Jianmin was introducing FY meteorological satellites. Source: NSMC\nAt present, the data observed by FY-3 has been used in most global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. FY satellites have made a positive contribution to improving the accuracy of global weather forecasting in these services.\nFurthermore, XU Jianmin also organized the development and distribution of quantitative products from FY satellites. He was engaged in the research on data preprocessing, derivation and application of quantitative products. This output has been recognized by CGMS (Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites).\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the software and hardware problems existing in FY meteorological satellites were almost solved, and they could complete monitoring tasks stably and with high quality. At that time, NWP in our country was being carried out in full swing. XU Jianmin believed that satellites could not only have cloud image products, but data could also play a instrumental role in NWP.\nImproving the accuracy of weather forecasts is our duty. He was determined to apply satellite data to NWP models and make greater contributions to the improvement of weather forecasting in China.\nEnhancing the accuracy of meteorological satellite products is the key for satellite data to enter NWP models. To verify the availability of the data, NSMC also sent FY meteorological satellite data to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for evaluation.\nThe first assessment result was not ideal, but XU Jianmin believed that it was a good thing and precisely pointed out the problem.\nCloud maps were all-encompassing. XU Jianmin required all personnel to look at cloud maps every day to learn and understand the weather from them. To enhance the accuracy of the data, he and his colleagues repeatedly revised, compared and analyzed it. They organized everyone to translate a large number of documents, study, think, analyze and summarize them into teaching materials.\nXU Jianmin was working. Source: NSMC\nBy observing cloud images, they attempted to use the movement of clouds to deduce the large-scale wind field distribution on Earth, significantly enhancing the level of wind forecasting and providing a new perspective for the international meteorological satellite community.\nThe revised and improved data were highly praised by ECMWF.\nCurrently, China has launched 21 FY meteorological satellites, with 8 in orbit. These satellites provide satellite data and products to 133 countries and regions around the world and offer emergency support services to over 70 countries.\nIn-orbit operation of FY meteorological satellites Source: NSMC\nThe IMO Prize is named after WMO's predecessor organization, which recognizes outstanding work in meteorology and hydrology and contributions to international collaboration.\nThe IMO Prize reflects WMO's commitment to scientific excellence and international collaboration. This prize is a full recognition of XU Jianmin's outstanding performance as well as the global contribution of the China' s FY Meteorological Satellites.\nEditor: LIU Shuqiao"

It is one of a suite of WMO scientific products to inform policy-making and to improve public safety and well-being.\nAlthough the global average of annual mean dust surface concentrations in 2024 was slightly lower than in 2023, there were big regional variations. In the most affected areas, the surface dust concentration in 2024 was higher than the long-term 1981-2010 average.\nEvery year, around 2,000 million tons of sand and dust enters the atmosphere - equivalent to 307 Great Pyramids of Giza. More than 80% of the global dust budget originates from the North African and Middle Eastern deserts and can be transported for hundreds and even thousands of kilometers, across continents and oceans.\nMuch of this is a natural process, but poor water and land management, drought and environmental degradation are increasingly to blame.\n“Sand and dust storms do not just mean dirty windows and hazy skies. They harm the health and quality of life of millions of people and cost many millions of dollars through disruption to air and ground transport, on agriculture and on solar energy production,” says WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n“This Bulletin shows how health risks and economic costs are rising – and how investments in dust early warnings and mitigation and control would reap large returns,” she said.  “This is why sand and dust storms are one of the priorities of the Early Warnings for All initiative.”\nThe WMO Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System coordinates international sand and dust research and has operational regional centres.\nThe report was released to coincide with the International Day of Combating Sand and Dust Storms on 12 July.\nSource: WMO\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "Sand and dust storms (SDS) present a formidable and wide-spread challenge to achieving sustainable development. They have become a serious global concern in recent decades due to their significant impacts on the environment, health, agriculture, livelihoods, and socio-economic well-being. SDS are an essential element of the Earth’s natural bio-chemical cycles, but are also caused in part by human activities, including unsustainable land management and water use. In turn, sand and dust storms contribute to climate change and air pollution.\nJuly 12 marks International Day of Combating Sand and Dust Storms. It is an occasion to reinforce the awareness of SDS prevention and take concerted action worldwide.\nThe China Meteorological Administration (CMA) attaches great importance to conducting the work of Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (BEIJING) for Atmospheric Sand and dust storm forecasting (RSMC-ASDF BEIJING) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and scored a series of fruitful results.\nIn 2025, CMA upgraded its independently developed sand and dust storm numerical weather prediction (NWP) system (hereinafter referred to as the System) to CMA-CW, achieving multiple technological breakthroughs. By introducing 3DVar technology, the System has integrated ground observation and satellite remote sensing data. Driven by the domestically developed CMA-MESO model, it is characterized by horizontal resolution enhanced to 15 km with 31 vertical levels, output at 1-hour interval, and forecasting efficiency up to 7 days.\nThrough the \"China-Japan-Korea + X\" multilateral mechanism, CMA has established a sand and dust storm joint prevention and control system with countries including Mongolia and Kazakhstan. This initiative is driving forward deeper collaboration in data sharing, joint monitoring, forecasting, as well as early warning.\nCMA is also focused on establishing cross-border sand dust and dust monitoring and forecasting for upstream source regions. This enables real-time tracking of sandstorm origins (e.g., the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, deserts in Central Asia) and provides 12-hour warning capabilities.\nIn 2023, CMA and the National Center of Meteorology of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed a bilateral intergovernmental Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on meteorological science and technology cooperation, marking the outset of China-UAE collaboration on sand and dust storm disaster prevention into a new phase of cooperation.\nThe National Meteorological Centre (NMC) of CMA has also conducted technical exchanges with its counterpart of UAE in 2025, reaching important consensus on enhancing sand and dust storm monitoring and early warning capacity building, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in the sand and dust storm domain, and others.\nTo enhance China's capabilities in sand and dust storm monitoring, early warning, and ecological governance, NMC and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) have deepened collaboration since 2022. Focusing on core areas including data sharing, technical exchanges, sand and dust storm forecasting/warning, impact assessment, and ecological benefit evaluation of desertification control, both sides jointly conducted field surveys in key sandstorm source regions such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. These efforts have enabled the precise identification of source region characteristics, transport patterns, and impact mechanisms, thus effectively advancing sand and dust storm disaster prevention and ecological governance processes.\nIn 2017, CMA was certified as RSMC-ASDF BEIJING, together with WMO Barcelona Dust Regional Center in Spain, becoming 2 dust storm warning and forecasting centres globally.\nSince 2021, CMA has continued to deepen its cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on sand and dust storm monitoring and early warning, promoting the construction of nodes for the GCC Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System (SDS-WAS).\nRSMC-ASDF Beijing has formed a dust meteorological service product system covering Asia, Europe, and Africa through FENGYUN (FY) meteorological satellites data sharing, 3DVar technology, and dust product R&D. It has established a joint sand and dust monitoring mechanism with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, India, and other main Members of the SDS-WAS. And it has also established a cross-border dust transport pathway database and consistently produces forecasts for total amount of sand and dust, surface dust concentration, the optical thickness at 550nm, and dry (wet) deposition every 3 hours.\nTo further implement the United Nations (UN)' Early Warnings for All (EW4ALL), CMA has developed the Belt and Road sand and dust storm data service platform. By integrating data from multiple satellite sources, such as FY-4 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), ground observations, and NWP models, the Platform enables real-time monitoring and sharing of dust storm dynamics in source regions such as the Sahara Desert, Central Asia, and the Mongolian Plateau. From March 10 to 11, 2025, a large-scale sandstorm swept across Mongolia and northern China, which was successfully monitored and forecasted by RSMC-ASDF Beijing.\nCMA-CW-v1.0-DUST Surface Dust Concentration Source: RSMC-ASDF Beijing\nIn September, 2025, the 11th Conference of WMO SDS-WAS and International Sandstorm Academic Symposium will be held in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China.\nSpecial thanks to GUI Hailin with the National Meteorological Centre of CMA\nPlanned by/Editor: LIU Shuqiao, JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "On June 28, the Flood Control and Drought Relief Command of Rongjiang County Government in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou, China, issued a notice upgrading the flood control emergency response from level 2 to level 1, requiring all personnel in seven flood-prone areas to evacuate.\nForecasters of the Prefecture Meteorological Observatory monitored rainfall and analyze future weather conditions. Photoed by YANG Changda\nMeteorological departments in Guizhou implemented a “24631” progressive meteorological service mechanism, closely coordinating warning issuance with government emergency responses. This mechanism has provided valuable time for the evacuation and relocation of residents, science-based reservoir management, and the precise deployment of rescue forces.\nThe “24631” progressive meteorological service involves issuing detailed forecasts for heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours at the city, county, and township level in advance, initiating weather consultations every 6 hours, updating short-range forecasts of heavy rainfall for the next 3 hours every 3 hours, and updating short-range forecasts of heavy rainfall for the next 3 hours every hour.\nIn response to this flood, Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Service activated an emergency response at 11:00 on June 24, and the Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Observatory continuously provided rolling updates on major meteorological information. During the peak period of heavy rainfall on June 28, the Observatory provided meteorological services to the rescue operations in Rongjiang County every 3 hours, with updates every hour. The relevant information was directly transmitted to the Emergency Command Centre of Department of Emergency Management of Guizhou Province, providing a basis for decision-making for the flood control coordination work of the Provincial Government.\nQiandongnan Prefectural Meteorological Department issued a weather information report at 15:00 on June 27, forecasting a trend of heavy rainfall. The warning signal was rapidly upgraded: A blue warning for heavy rain across the Prefecture was issued at 17:30 on June 27, upgraded to an orange warning at 07:25 on June 28, and decisively elevated to the highest-level red warning at 09:25. Emergency response measures were simultaneously upgraded: A Level 4 response was initiated at 17:00 on June 27, upgraded to Level 3 at 07:30 on June 28, and further upgraded to Level 1 at 09:50.\nMeteorological offices in counties such as Rongjiang, Danzhai, and Leishan, which were at the core of the heavy rainfall, acted swiftly upon receiving flood warnings and issued 19 heavy rainfall warning signals by the early morning of June 28. Staff from Danzhai and Leishan Meteorological Offices went to the local emergency management bureaus for joint work during the peak period of heavy rainfall, providing precise and timely meteorological service data for frontline rescue and disaster relief efforts. Since June 25, Rongjiang County Meteorological Office has established 3 meteorological service teams responsible for operations, support, and rescue work, respectively, to continuously update warning information, ensure the stable operation of meteorological operational systems, and conduct road clearance and drainage system maintenance.\nIn this response to the rainstorm, the provincial, municipal, and county meteorological departments worked together efficiently, with early warnings closely coordinated with government emergency responses, providing valuable time for personnel evacuation, science-based reservoir management, and the precise deployment of rescue strengths.\nSpecial thanks to YANG Chunzhu, DONG Peiyuan, GONG Ke of meteorological departments of Guizhou\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "Recently, the world's first Artificial intelligence-driven Global Aerosol-Meteorology Forecasting System (AI-GAMFS), developed by a team led by CHE Huizheng, researcher from the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS), has been available on the International Meteorological Early Warning Operational Support Platform (hereinafter referred to as “the Early Warning Platform”) at the World Meteorological Centre Beijing (WMC-BJ).\nAs human activities and the impacts of climate change intensify, issues such as dust storms and wildfires—which contribute to atmospheric aerosol pollution, have become increasingly severe, heightening the urgent need for precise forecasts. The research team overcame key technical challenges in aerosol-meteorological spatiotemporal coupling intelligent forecasting, developed an AI large-scale model encompassing 54 forecast variables based on a 42-year global advanced aerosol reanalysis dataset, enabling more precise characterization of the complex interactions between aerosols and meteorological phenomena. Previously, AI-GAMFS has been implemented for operational work of National Meteorological Centre (NMC) of China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and meteorological services in 12 provinces (autonomous regions) across China, including Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shaanxi.\nThe main advantage of AI-GAMFS lies in its exceptionally high computational efficiency, enabling global-scale forecasts of optical properties, ground concentrations, and related meteorological elements for key aerosol components such as dust, sulfates, black carbon, organic carbon, and sea salt over a 5-day period with 3-hour intervals, at a spatial resolution of 50 kilometers, all within just 36 seconds per run. After integrating with the Early Warning Platform, it is expected to significantly enhance the operational capabilities and timeliness of global aerosol pollution forecasting.\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

It is one of a suite of WMO scientific products to inform policy-making and to improve public safety and well-being.\nAlthough the global average of annual mean dust surface concentrations in 2024 was slightly lower than in 2023, there were big regional variations. In the most affected areas, the surface dust concentration in 2024 was higher than the long-term 1981-2010 average.\nEvery year, around 2,000 million tons of sand and dust enters the atmosphere - equivalent to 307 Great Pyramids of Giza. More than 80% of the global dust budget originates from the North African and Middle Eastern deserts and can be transported for hundreds and even thousands of kilometers, across continents and oceans.\nMuch of this is a natural process, but poor water and land management, drought and environmental degradation are increasingly to blame.\n“Sand and dust storms do not just mean dirty windows and hazy skies. They harm the health and quality of life of millions of people and cost many millions of dollars through disruption to air and ground transport, on agriculture and on solar energy production,” says WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n“This Bulletin shows how health risks and economic costs are rising – and how investments in dust early warnings and mitigation and control would reap large returns,” she said.  “This is why sand and dust storms are one of the priorities of the Early Warnings for All initiative.”\nThe WMO Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System coordinates international sand and dust research and has operational regional centres.\nThe report was released to coincide with the International Day of Combating Sand and Dust Storms on 12 July.\nSource: WMO\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "Why do we carry out vertical profile observation and what is the status quo and development of vertical profile observation of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA)?\nThis article will offer a thorough overview. Let's dig deeper.\n1. Why do we carry out vertical profile observation？\nVertical meteorological observation refers to the three-dimensional and continuous detection of meteorological elements (such as temperature, humidity, wind, aerosol, water condensates) at different altitudes. Ground-based vertical profile observation system (VPOS) integrates millimeter-wave cloud radar, microwave radiometer, Global Navigation Satellite System/ Meteorology (GNSS/MET), wind profile radar and aerosol lidar. It realizes high spatio-temporal resolution continuous observation of meteorological elements at different altitudes such as temperature, humidity, wind, aerosol, and water condensates. This system is designed to characterize the variations in atmospheric vertical structure and provides critical data support for meteorological research, severe weather forecasting, and numerical weather prediction (NWP).\n2. Composition of the VPOS\nThe VPOS is composed of five types of observation equipment, including millimeter-wave cloud radar, microwave radiometer, GNSS/MET, wind profile radar, aerosol lidar and a set of ground-based remote sensing vertical profile integrated system, which realizes the synergistic observation of temperature, humidity, wind, aerosol and water condensates profiles.\nFig. 1 Composition of the VPOS\n3. What are the VPOS products?\na. Wind profile radar observation product\nThe wind profile radar continuously provides height-distributed variations in meteorological parameters, such as horizontal wind field and vertical airflow.\nFig. 2 Wind profile radar\nBasic meteorological products: Horizontal wind (direction, speed), vertical velocity, and constant of refractive index of atmospheric structure（Cn2）\nTemporal resolution: 6 min\nSpatial resolution: at 120 m intervals\nSounding height:150 m to 6 km\nFig. 3 Wind profile radar horizontal wind products\nFig. 4 wind profile radar vertical velocity products\nb.

Multi-element integrated product\nThe VPOS is able to simultaneously observe temperature, humidity, wind, aerosols and water condensates, which can generate multi-element integrated products.\nFig. 21 Five vertical profiles in one plot (left) and temperature-logarithmic pressure diagram (right)\ng. Low-level jet products\nThe horizontal wind field can be used to retrieve low-level jet products, including low-level jet surface products below 600 hPa, low-level jet vertical products and low-level jet index. The products can characterize water vapor conditions and uplift triggering mechanisms, which are mainly used in nowcasting services for severe convection.\nFig. 22 Low-level jet products\nh.

Temperature advection product\nHorizontal wind fields can be used to derive temperature advection product, which reflects the stability of atmospheric stratification. If the vertical variation rate of temperature advection is greater than 0, it indicates enhanced unstable stratification, which is favorable for the development of weather systems. This product is commonly used in monitoring cold wave.\nFig. 24 Temperature advection product\n4. Application cases of the VPOS\na. Snowfall case in Beijing on February 20, 2024\nThrough the comprehensive analysis of relative humidity profile products and cloud/precipitation type products, it is evident that starting from 03:00 on February 20, influenced by a southwesterly warm moist airflow, humidity significantly increased around 3 km altitude. The moist layer expanded to 1-6 km, providing ample moisture conditions for snowfall. By 17:00, the precipitation phase was transformed to snow at the surface. The onset time of snowfall was detected earlier by the VPOS than by the surface stations.\nFig. 25 Millimeter wave cloud radar surface precipitation classification product\nFig. 26 Microwave radiometer temperature and humidity profile products\nb. Haze case in Beijing from March 5 to 9, 2023\nAccording to the comprehensive analysis of extinction coefficient, temperature profile, horizontal wind, boundary layer height, and humidity profile fusion products, the concentration of haze was higher during the morning of March 5 to March 6 and early morning of March 7 to March 8. From the night of the March 5 to the morning of March 6, and on the morning of March 7, the near-surface humidity was higher, which was conducive to the hygroscopic growth of haze particles. Between the morning of March 5 until 00:00 on March 6, and from the afternoon of March 6 to the afternoon of March 7, the middle and lower atmospheric layers were dominated by southerly wind, which were favorable for the transport and accumulation of haze with the help of the northern terrain. Temperature inversion layer existed during three critical periods: night of March 5 to morning of March 6, night of March 6 to morning of March 7, and night of March 7 to morning of March 8, and the boundary layer height was low, which was not conducive to the diffusion of haze.\nFig. 27 Aerosol lidar extinction coefficient product\nFig. 28 Microwave radiometer temperature profile product\nFig. 29 Integrated product of horizontal wind, boundary layer height, and humidity profile\nIn collaboration with Department of Integrated Observations of CMA and CMA Meteorological Observation Centre (MOC)\nImage source: CMA MOC\nEditor: LIU Shuqiao"

The Haiyan II unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flew from Chaoyang Airport to the Bohai Bay area to \"capture\" an upcoming rain that was closely related to Northeast Cold Vortex.\nThis is the first time that meteorological departments have carried out a large-scale UAV observation experiment of the Northeast Cold Vortex, aiming to further enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts and disaster warning capabilities, while promoting the application of low-altitude economic commercial scenarios and public service scenarios.\nNortheast Cold Vortex, is an important weather system of the East Asian Atmospheric Circulation, shaping the regional precipitation distribution, temperature fluctuations and seasonal characteristics, but also incurring severe weather such as continuous rainstorm and floods, cold wave, gales and sandstorms.\nThe mesoscale convective systems induced by the Northeast Cold Vortex are characterized by locality, suddenness, recurrence, and asymmetry, making it difficult for forecasters to grasp its intensity, affected area, and timing of the severe weather caused by them.\nOn June 19, meteorological workers were making preparations for the flight of \"Haiyan\" II UAV at Chaoyang Airport. Photoed  by LIU Sisi\nThis time, Haiyan II conducted mobile observation targeting the ocean, complex terrain and convective sensitive areas. It has covered a distance of approximately 400 km, dropped four radiosondes, and accumulated about 5,000 valid observation data. It returned at 6:55.\nThe high-resolution vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, pressure and wind within and in key areas of the Cold Vortex obtained through UAV down-drop observation can more accurately diagnose information such as water vapor transport channels, fine structures of low-altitude jet streams, and the distribution of convective unstable energy. Meanwhile, high-resolution and three-dimensional observation data are directly assimilated into the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model.\nThis experiment was jointly organized and implemented by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) Meteorological Observation Centre and the Liaoning Provincial Meteorological Service.\nEditor: LIU Shuqiao"

Let's review some of those extreme weather events worldwide through the\nlens of FENGYUN (FY) meteorological satellites\nof China\n.\nIn May, the forest fire\ncondition\nin southeastern Russia remained severe, with fires spreading westward from Amur Oblast. Monitoring\ncaptured\nby FY-3D\nshowed that on May 4, fire hotspots were mainly detected in Russia's Trans-Baikal Krai, Buryat Republic and other regions.\nAffected by the combined influence of upper-level troughs and low-level jets, southern Brazil and northeastern Argentina in South America were\nhit\nby heavy precipitation. On May 7, 2025, convective cloud clusters in central South America developed vigorously. The cloud top height product of F\nY\n-3E\ndisplayed\nthat the cloud top height in some areas approached 20 km on\nMay\n7.\nSince May 22, 2025, multiple fire spots have occurred in Saskatchewan, central Canada. On May 25, the monitoring of FY-3D demonstrated that the fire\ncondition\ndeveloped rapidly, with the distribution area of fire spots significantly expanding. A large amount of smoke diffused northeastward, causing widespread air pollution.\nThe cyclonic cloud system in the Bay of Bengal brought heavy rainfall to Bangladesh and Myanmar. FY-4B monitoring from 21:00 on May 29 to 03:15 on May 30 showed that the land-based severe convection center was located in Bangladesh. The cloud-top brightness temperature over the area in Dhaka was lower than -72℃, and the precipitation intensity at the convection center reached 50 mm/h. Afterwards, the precipitation center shifted to the southeastern parts of Bangladesh and the coastal areas in northwestern Myanmar.\nAffected by Typhoon Wutip over the South China Sea, central Vietnam has seen a continuous heavy rainfall process since 00:00 on June 11, 2025. The superimposed monitoring animation of true-color and precipitation assessment products from FY-4B showed that the heavy rainfall center shifted westward from the South China Sea to Quảng Nam and Quảng Ngãi Provinces in central Vietnam. This region first experienced 4 hours of continuous torrential rain, with rainfall fluctuating between moderate, heavy, and torrential levels.\nAt noon local time on June 22, a wildfire broke out on Chios Island in the eastern Aegean Sea, Greece, and strong winds caused the fire and thick smoke to spread rapidly. FY-3D monitored multiple obvious heat sources, with a large amount of smoke and dust drifting southwestward.\nIn collaboration with the National Satellite Meteorological Centre (National Centre for Space Weather) of the China Meteorological Administration\nPlanned by/Editor: LIU Shuqiao"

    "source": "China Meteorological News Press",
    "content_text": "On December 27, 2024, annual report on actions to address climate change (2024) (hereinafter referred to as the Green Book of Climate Change) was released in Beijing, China. It is an authoritative annual publication jointly initiated by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and compiled by scholars in the field of climate change in China.\nNo. 16 Green Book of Climate Change\nThe Green Book of Climate Change includes important chapters such as general report, new insight of climate change science, the international climate process, domestic policies and actions, industrial transformation, and urban evaluation, and points out that the challenges posed by climate change are becoming increasingly severe and that countries need to strengthen cooperation in the area of green and low-carbon development.\nClimate change\nThe Green Book of Climate Change points out that, at present, the challenge of global climate change to human society is increasingly severe. 2023 is the warmest year since meteorological records began.The global average temperature is about 1.45 ± 0.12 ℃ above pre-industrial levels.And year 2015-2023 are the warmest nine years since meteorological records began. Extreme weather and climate continue to have serious social impacts.\nAccording to The Green Book of Climate Change, China has made remarkable progresses in areas such as renewable energy, electric vehicles and green architecture, while promoting carbon emission reduction through mechanisms such as the carbon emissions trading market. In addition, China has actively participated in international climate cooperation and promoted green development in developing countries through the Belt and Road Initiative.\nNew technology\nThe Green Book of Climate Change shows that at present, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved better application results in the field of climate, and has the potential to be widely applied in the field of addressing climate change. In the future, AI is expected to play a more and more critical role in climate change mitigation, adaptation and other aspects. Besides,  its integration with meteorological disciplines will provide strong scientific and technological support to enhance the accuracy of climate prediction and climate change prediction.\nCarrying out meteorological early warning is an effective approach to enhance climate change adaptation capacity and promote sustainable development. The Green Book of Climate Change shows that Africa, as one of the regions most seriously threatened by climate change, has been severely affected by the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events and intensified climate disasters in recent years, seriously affecting the production and life of African people, so international cooperation and broad multi-partner engagement are required. Under the framework ofinitiatives of the United Nations (UN) and others, some countries and international organizations have provided Africa with relevant mechanisms, initiatives and projects to jointly promote the realization of Early Warnings for All Initiative of UN, which has enabled a significant improvement in the early warning capacity of African countries.\n“Dual carbon” goal\nNew quality productive forcesare a kind of green productivity. Since China put forward “dual carbon”goal, it has formulated a “1+N” policy system of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality with“dual carbon” as an important starting point, providing a powerful impetus for the development of New quality productive forces and achieved positive results which deserve global recognition.\nThe Green Book of Climate Change showcases that China's green and low-carbon transportation policies have been effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the resilience of the transportation system, and promoting sustainable development, thus providing experience for the global response to climate change. By optimizing the transportation structure, promoting low-carbon facilities and strengthening pollution prevention and control, China is gradually achieving a low-carbon and efficient traffic system, and promoting the achievement of “dual carbon” goal.\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "updated": "14-01-2025",

    "content_text": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has confirmed that 2024 is the warmest year on record, based on six international datasets. The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nEd Hawkins\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 °C  (with a margin of uncertainty of ± 0.13 °C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO’s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5°C above the 1850-1900 average.\n“Today’s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again – global heating is a cold, hard fact,” said UN Secretary-General Antóno Guterres.\n“Individual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,” he said. “There's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act – now,” he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK’s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n“Climate history is playing out before our eyes. We’ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n“It is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5°C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5°C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,” said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments. All six datasets place 2024 as the warmest year on record and all highlight the recent rate of warming. But not all show the temperature anomaly above 1.5 °C due to differing methodologies.\nThe timing of the release of the six temperature datasets was coordinated across the institutions in order to underline the exceptional conditions experienced during 2024.\nA separate study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that ocean warming in 2024 played a key role in the record high temperatures. The ocean is the warmest it has ever been as recorded by humans, not only at the surface but also for the upper 2000 meters, according to the study led by Prof. Lijing Cheng with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world’s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nSource: WMO\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

    "content_text": "More than 2,000 years ago, LI Bing, a famous water conservancy expert in the Warring States period left the stone rhinoceros to guard a side of the water and soil peace in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. More than 2,000 years later, Chengdu Municipal Meteorological Department joined hands with the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau Meteorological Research Institute, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) to create an artificial intelligence (AI) weather model of local short-range forecast “Rongcheng - Lingxi (means wise rhinoceros in Chinese)”(hereafter referred to as the Model), and continued to write a new chapter of meteorological disaster prevention and mitigation.\nIn March 2024, the Model was formally put into operation, which is based on AI technology to realize the next 2 hours of time resolution of 6 minutes, spatial resolution as fine as 1 km radar combination of reflectivity extrapolation forecast. With the rapid updating of forecasts, the 0-2 hour rainfall forecast is as fine as 5 min and 100 m.\nThe basic core of the Model originates from the physical constraints-based radar combined reflectivity factor extrapolation algorithm, which realizes the accurate analysis and prediction of meteorological data through the training and testing of deep neural network model.\nMoreover, its innovative core lies in the Model's ability to integrate multiple meteorological elements and capture long-term dependencies and short-term dynamic changes in the time series through the memory module and perceptual attention mechanism, which effectively improves the extrapolation capability of radar echoes. Through the motion feature extraction and perceptual attention, the Model shows good prediction effect in dealing with complex meteorological systems, especially severe convective weather, and the prediction capability is improved by 5% compared with that of traditional models.\nAt midnight on July 23, 2024, locally short-term heavy precipitation occurred in the western mountains of Chengdu. After the discussions between city and county-level meteorological departments, 5 cities (counties)  issued a red rainstorm warning signal 90 minutes in advance\naccording to the forecast conclusions of the Model\n. The forecast of the Model was highly consistent with the actual situation, which confirmed the good prediction performance of the short-term model on the development and movement of mesoscale convective systems under complex terrain.\nChengdu Garden, the main venue of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2024 Chengdu Source: Chengdu Daily\nLast year, based on the Model,\nChengdu\nMunicipal Meteorological Department\nimplemented progressive, full-chain meteorological services, effectively responded to 8 regional rainstorms and 53 severe convective weather processes, and at the same time escorted more than 60 events such as the\nInternational Horticultural Exhibition 2024 Chengdu\n.\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing"

The Editorial Office was moved to Xiangzhuang, Beipei, Chongqing.\nIn 1962, the Editorial Office was moved to No. 7 Wuta Temple, Beijing and stationed there ever after (the street was renamed to be the current one later).\nIn September 1987, AMS English Edition was officially launched.\nIn 1996, AMS changed from quarterly into bimonthly.\nIn 2014, AMS English Edition (Acta Meteorologica Sinica) was renamed as Journal of Meteorological Research (JMR)，with a new ISSN 2095-6037, and a new Editorial Board (The Board started to try run since October 2012).\nOver a century, ZHU Kezhen's curve has become pivotal in global climate studies; TU Changwang first integrated China's data into worldwide climate research; YE Duzheng decoded the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau's \"thermal dynamics\" to explain East Asian monsoons. Each volume of JMR bears tenacious and pioneering imprints.\nFrom its first article to the Sicence Citation Index (SCI) -indexed English edition, China's meteorology has gradually gained prominence on the globe stage. From ink-smudged pages to refined prints, JMR chronicles the meteorological scientific progress; from mimeographed sheets to instant digital access, it constantly mirrors China's technological rise. From irregular issues to bimonthly issues, its Chinese and English editions make their presence worldwide. Every page-turn expands meteorology's horizons and arouses civilization's dialogue.\nMore than a mere publication, JMR incubates paradigm shifts and chronicles the growth of China's meteorological talents.\nPlanned by/Editor: LIU Shuqiao"

Weather elements such as temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation can significantly impact the events, which calls for more accurate and timely meteorological information.Therefore, the Department has established a multi-layered, high-density monitoring network. Building on the existing 61 weather stations, 26 new monitoring stations have been added, including 7 laser wind-measuring radars with a spatial resolution refined to 15 m, enabling second-scale three-dimensional (3D) data collection for wind, temperature, and humidity.\nThe system also incorporates the China Meteorological Administration (CMA)'s ground-based remote sensing vertical observation system, which provides minute-scale vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and wind direction from the ground up to 10 km in altitude.\nAdditionally, FENGYUN-4B meteorological satellite has performed continuous scans at 1-minute interval, with 13 operational upper-air stations conducting four to eight daily soundings, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and multi-radar networks working in coordination. This has laid a solid foundation for the application of meteorological \"digital twin\" technology.\n\"Digital Twin\": Simulating weather risks in virtual venues\nThe Department has innovatively applied \"digital twin\" technology, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and 3D visualization modeling to recreate the core areas of the opening ceremony, integrating meteorological elements with event scenarios. The National Meteorological Information Centre (NMIC) of CMA, in collaboration with Sichuan Municipal Meteorological Observation Data Centre and the Department, has developed a 3D wind field analysis product with a resolution of 5 meters, capable of accurately capturing complex wind patterns. A \"digital twin\" meteorological field with a grid resolution of 10 m at 5-second interval.\nIt is informed that this has made the event operations and weather risks visually synchronized, allowing organizers to quickly and clearly grasp weather conditions and their potential impacts, underpinning science-based deployment.\n\"One Event, One Strategy\": AI-Driven Precision Services\nTo meet the diverse needs of the 34 events, the Department has introduced a \"One event, One strategy\" service model, offering a catalog of 10 categories and 19 types of products.\nFrom pre-event weather monitoring to minute-scale forecast updates during competitions, and short-range warnings for sudden weather changes, the system has ensured the comprehensive coverage.\nFor instance,at water-based venues like Xinglong Lake and Sancha Lake, the \"World Games Connect\" App provides real-time weather updates, and meteorological liaison officers deliver specialized bilingual forecasts at 08:00on a daily basis, helping organizers manage critical indicators such as wind speed and visibility on the lake surface.\nBy harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze real-time monitoring data, the team can generate risk warnings and produce hyper-local, minute-scale precise forecasts, the accuracy of key period forecasts to 91%.\nNext, Chengdu will inherit a denser network of meteorological observation stations, a smarter \"digital twin\" platform, and enhance scenario-based service capabilities, which will refine the meteorological servicesfrom event support to urban operations, continuously empowering Chengdu's smart development.\nContributed by ZHANG Yiwen; LI Chunyi, XU Chen\nEditor: LIU Shuqiao, GAO Yuping"
